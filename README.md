# Design Patterns

Explore this Java repository to understand and implement Creational, Structural, and Behavioral design patterns. Enhance your coding practices and build scalable, maintainable software using these proven principles.

## Creational Design Patterns

### Singleton Pattern
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.

### Factory Method Pattern
Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses.

### Abstract Factory Pattern
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Prototype Pattern
Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### Builder Pattern
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## Structural Design Patterns

### Adapter Pattern
Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.

### Decorator Pattern
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Composite Pattern
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients can treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

### Observer Pattern
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. Clients can choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.
