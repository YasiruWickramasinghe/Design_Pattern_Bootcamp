# Prototype Pattern in Java: Mastering Object Cloning for Efficient Instantiation

## Intent of Design Pattern

The Prototype pattern is used to specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new instances through object cloning

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

Imagine a company that manufactures custom-designed furniture. Instead of creating each piece from scratch every time an order is placed, they keep prototypes of their most popular designs. When a customer places an order for a specific design, the company simply clones the prototype of that design and makes the necessary customizations. This approach saves time and resources as the basic structure and design details are already in place, allowing the company to quickly fulfill orders with consistent quality.

In this scenario, the furniture prototypes act like object prototypes in software, enabling efficient creation of new, customized pieces based on existing models.

## When to Use

* When the classes to instantiate are specified at run-time, for example, by dynamic loading.
* To avoid building a class hierarchy of factories that parallels the class hierarchy of products.
* When instances of a class can have one of only a few different combinations of state. It may be more convenient to install a corresponding number of prototypes and clone them rather than instantiating the class manually, each time with the appropriate state.
* When object creation is expensive compared to cloning.
* When the concrete classes to instantiate are unknown until runtime.

## Pseudocode
```code
// Base prototype.
abstract class Shape is
    field X: int
    field Y: int
    field color: string

    // A regular constructor.
    constructor Shape() is
        // ...

    // The prototype constructor. A fresh object is initialized
    // with values from the existing object.
    constructor Shape(source: Shape) is
        this()
        this.X = source.X
        this.Y = source.Y
        this.color = source.color

    // The clone operation returns one of the Shape subclasses.
    abstract method clone():Shape


// Concrete prototype. The cloning method creates a new object
// in one go by calling the constructor of the current class and
// passing the current object as the constructor's argument.
// Performing all the actual copying in the constructor helps to
// keep the result consistent: the constructor will not return a
// result until the new object is fully built; thus, no object
// can have a reference to a partially-built clone.
class Rectangle extends Shape is
    field width: int
    field height: int

    constructor Rectangle(source: Rectangle) is
        // A parent constructor call is needed to copy private
        // fields defined in the parent class.
        super(source)
        this.width = source.width
        this.height = source.height

    method clone():Shape is
        return new Rectangle(this)


class Circle extends Shape is
    field radius: int

    constructor Circle(source: Circle) is
        super(source)
        this.radius = source.radius

    method clone():Shape is
        return new Circle(this)


// Somewhere in the client code.
class Application is
    field shapes: array of Shape

    constructor Application() is
        Circle circle = new Circle()
        circle.X = 10
        circle.Y = 10
        circle.radius = 20
        shapes.add(circle)

        Circle anotherCircle = circle.clone()
        shapes.add(anotherCircle)
        // The `anotherCircle` variable contains an exact copy
        // of the `circle` object.

        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle()
        rectangle.width = 10
        rectangle.height = 20
        shapes.add(rectangle)

    method businessLogic() is
        // Prototype rocks because it lets you produce a copy of
        // an object without knowing anything about its type.
        Array shapesCopy = new Array of Shapes.

        // For instance, we don't know the exact elements in the
        // shapes array. All we know is that they are all
        // shapes. But thanks to polymorphism, when we call the
        // `clone` method on a shape the program checks its real
        // class and runs the appropriate clone method defined
        // in that class. That's why we get proper clones
        // instead of a set of simple Shape objects.
        foreach (s in shapes) do
            shapesCopy.add(s.clone())

        // The `shapesCopy` array contains exact copies of the
        // `shape` array's children.
```

## How to Implement
1) Create the prototype interface and declare the clone method in it. Or just add the method to all classes of an existing class hierarchy, if you have one.

2) A prototype class must define the alternative constructor that accepts an object of that class as an argument. The constructor must copy the values of all fields defined in the class from the passed object into the newly created instance. If you’re changing a subclass, you must call the parent constructor to let the superclass handle the cloning of its private fields.
   If your programming language doesn’t support method overloading, you won’t be able to create a separate “prototype” constructor. Thus, copying the object’s data into the newly created clone will have to be performed within the clone method. Still, having this code in a regular constructor is safer because the resulting object is returned fully configured right after you call the new operator.

3) The cloning method usually consists of just one line: running a new operator with the prototypical version of the constructor. Note, that every class must explicitly override the cloning method and use its own class name along with the new operator. Otherwise, the cloning method may produce an object of a parent class.

4) Optionally, create a centralized prototype registry to store a catalog of frequently used prototypes.
   You can implement the registry as a new factory class or put it in the base prototype class with a static method for fetching the prototype. This method should search for a prototype based on search criteria that the client code passes to the method. The criteria might either be a simple string tag or a complex set of search parameters. After the appropriate prototype is found, the registry should clone it and return the copy to the client.
   Finally, replace the direct calls to the subclasses’ constructors with calls to the factory method of the prototype registry.
