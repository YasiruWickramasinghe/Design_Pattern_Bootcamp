# Singleton Pattern in Java: Implementing Global Access Points in Java Applications

## Intent of Design Pattern

Ensure a Java class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to this singleton instance.

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

A real-world analogy for the Singleton pattern is a government issuing a passport. In a country, each citizen can only be issued one valid passport at a time. The passport office ensures that no duplicate passports are issued to the same person. Whenever a citizen needs to travel, they must use this single passport, which serves as the unique, globally recognized identifier for their travel credentials. This controlled access and unique instance management mirrors how the Singleton pattern ensures efficient object management in Java applications.

## When to Use

* There must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point
* When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code
