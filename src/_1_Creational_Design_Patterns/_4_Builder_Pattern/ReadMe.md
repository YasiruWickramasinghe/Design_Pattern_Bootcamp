# Builder Pattern in Java: Crafting Custom Objects with Clarity

## Intent of Design Pattern

The Builder design pattern in Java, a fundamental creational pattern, allows for the step-by-step construction of complex objects. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

The Java Builder pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where object creation involves numerous parameters.

Imagine you are building a customizable sandwich at a deli. The Builder design pattern in this context would involve a SandwichBuilder that allows you to specify each component of the sandwich, such as the type of bread, meat, cheese, vegetables, and condiments. Instead of having to know how to construct the sandwich from scratch, you use the SandwichBuilder to add each desired component step-by-step, ensuring you get exactly the sandwich you want. This separation of construction from the final product representation ensures that the same construction process can yield different types of sandwiches based on the specified components.

## When to Use

* The Builder pattern is ideal for Java applications requiring complex object creation.
* The algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled
* The construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed
* It's particularly useful when a product requires a lot of steps to be created and when these steps need to be executed in a specific sequence
