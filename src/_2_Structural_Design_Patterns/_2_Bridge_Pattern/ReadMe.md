# Bridge Pattern in Java: Decouple Abstraction from Implementation

## Intent of Design Pattern

The Bridge design pattern is a structural pattern in Java that decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This pattern is essential for developing flexible and extensible software systems

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

In Java, the Bridge pattern is commonly used in GUI frameworks, database drivers, and device drivers. For instance, a universal remote control (abstraction) can operate various TV brands (implementations) through a consistent interface.

Imagine a universal remote control (abstraction) that can operate different brands and types of televisions (implementations). The remote control provides a consistent interface for operations like turning on/off, changing channels, and adjusting the volume. Each television brand or type has its own specific implementation of these operations. By using the Bridge pattern, the remote control interface is decoupled from the television implementations, allowing the remote control to work with any television regardless of its brand or internal workings. This separation allows new television models to be added without changing the remote control's code, and different remote controls can be developed to work with the same set of televisions.

## When to Use

* You need to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation, such as when the implementation must be chosen or switched at runtime.
* Both the abstractions and their implementations should be extendable via subclassing, allowing independent extension of each component.
* Changes to the implementation of an abstraction should not affect clients, meaning their code should not require recompilation.
* You encounter a large number of classes in your hierarchy, indicating the need to split an object into two parts, a concept referred to as "nested generalizations" by Rumbaugh.
* You want to share an implementation among multiple objects, potentially using reference counting, while keeping this detail hidden from the client, as exemplified by Coplien's String class, where multiple objects can share the same string representation
