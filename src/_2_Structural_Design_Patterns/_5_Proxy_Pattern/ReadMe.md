# Proxy Pattern in Java: Enhancing Security and Control with Smart Proxies

## Intent of Design Pattern

The Proxy pattern in Java provides a surrogate or placeholder to effectively control access to an object, enhancing security and resource management

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

In a real-world scenario, consider a security guard at a gated community. The security guard acts as a proxy for the residents. When a visitor arrives, the guard checks the visitor's credentials and permissions before allowing them access to the community. If the visitor is authorized, the guard grants entry; if not, entry is denied. This ensures that only authorized individuals can access the community, much like a Proxy design pattern controls access to a specific object.

## When to Use

* Control access to another object
* Lazy initialization
* Implement logging
* Facilitate network connection
* Count references to an object
* Provide a local representation for an object that is in a different address space.

## Pseudocode
```code
// The interface of a remote service.
interface ThirdPartyYouTubeLib is
    method listVideos()
    method getVideoInfo(id)
    method downloadVideo(id)

// The concrete implementation of a service connector. Methods
// of this class can request information from YouTube. The speed
// of the request depends on a user's internet connection as
// well as YouTube's. The application will slow down if a lot of
// requests are fired at the same time, even if they all request
// the same information.
class ThirdPartyYouTubeClass implements ThirdPartyYouTubeLib is
    method listVideos() is
        // Send an API request to YouTube.

    method getVideoInfo(id) is
        // Get metadata about some video.

    method downloadVideo(id) is
        // Download a video file from YouTube.

// To save some bandwidth, we can cache request results and keep
// them for some time. But it may be impossible to put such code
// directly into the service class. For example, it could have
// been provided as part of a third party library and/or defined
// as `final`. That's why we put the caching code into a new
// proxy class which implements the same interface as the
// service class. It delegates to the service object only when
// the real requests have to be sent.
class CachedYouTubeClass implements ThirdPartyYouTubeLib is
    private field service: ThirdPartyYouTubeLib
    private field listCache, videoCache
    field needReset

    constructor CachedYouTubeClass(service: ThirdPartyYouTubeLib) is
        this.service = service

    method listVideos() is
        if (listCache == null || needReset)
            listCache = service.listVideos()
        return listCache

    method getVideoInfo(id) is
        if (videoCache == null || needReset)
            videoCache = service.getVideoInfo(id)
        return videoCache

    method downloadVideo(id) is
        if (!downloadExists(id) || needReset)
            service.downloadVideo(id)

// The GUI class, which used to work directly with a service
// object, stays unchanged as long as it works with the service
// object through an interface. We can safely pass a proxy
// object instead of a real service object since they both
// implement the same interface.
class YouTubeManager is
    protected field service: ThirdPartyYouTubeLib

    constructor YouTubeManager(service: ThirdPartyYouTubeLib) is
        this.service = service

    method renderVideoPage(id) is
        info = service.getVideoInfo(id)
        // Render the video page.

    method renderListPanel() is
        list = service.listVideos()
        // Render the list of video thumbnails.

    method reactOnUserInput() is
        renderVideoPage()
        renderListPanel()

// The application can configure proxies on the fly.
class Application is
    method init() is
        aYouTubeService = new ThirdPartyYouTubeClass()
        aYouTubeProxy = new CachedYouTubeClass(aYouTubeService)
        manager = new YouTubeManager(aYouTubeProxy)
        manager.reactOnUserInput()
```

## How to Implement
1) If there’s no pre-existing service interface, create one to make proxy and service objects interchangeable. Extracting the interface from the service class isn’t always possible, because you’d need to change all of the service’s clients to use that interface. Plan B is to make the proxy a subclass of the service class, and this way it’ll inherit the interface of the service.

2) Create the proxy class. It should have a field for storing a reference to the service. Usually, proxies create and manage the whole life cycle of their services. On rare occasions, a service is passed to the proxy via a constructor by the client.

3) Implement the proxy methods according to their purposes. In most cases, after doing some work, the proxy should delegate the work to the service object.

4) Consider introducing a creation method that decides whether the client gets a proxy or a real service. This can be a simple static method in the proxy class or a full-blown factory method.

5) Consider implementing lazy initialization for the service object.
