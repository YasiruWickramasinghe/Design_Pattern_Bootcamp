# Proxy Pattern in Java: Enhancing Security and Control with Smart Proxies

## Intent of Design Pattern

The Proxy pattern in Java provides a surrogate or placeholder to effectively control access to an object, enhancing security and resource management

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

In a real-world scenario, consider a security guard at a gated community. The security guard acts as a proxy for the residents. When a visitor arrives, the guard checks the visitor's credentials and permissions before allowing them access to the community. If the visitor is authorized, the guard grants entry; if not, entry is denied. This ensures that only authorized individuals can access the community, much like a Proxy design pattern controls access to a specific object.

## When to Use

* Control access to another object
* Lazy initialization
* Implement logging
* Facilitate network connection
* Count references to an object
* Provide a local representation for an object that is in a different address space.
