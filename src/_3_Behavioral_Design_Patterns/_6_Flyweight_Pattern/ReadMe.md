# Flyweight Pattern in Java: Maximizing Memory Efficiency with Shared Object Instances

## Intent of Design Pattern

The Flyweight design pattern in Java is crucial for optimizing memory usage and enhancing application performance. By minimizing the number of objects created, it significantly reduces the memory footprint. The primary goal of the Flyweight pattern is to share as much data as possible among similar objects, thereby improving efficiency and performance

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

A real-world application of the Flyweight pattern in Java can be seen in text editors like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. These applications use Flyweight to efficiently manage memory by sharing character objects, reducing the memory footprint significantly. In such applications, each character in a document could potentially be a separate object, which would be highly inefficient in terms of memory usage. Instead, the Flyweight pattern can be used to share character objects. For instance, all instances of the letter 'A' can share a single 'A' object with its intrinsic state (e.g., the shape of the character). The extrinsic state, such as the position, font, and color, can be stored separately and applied as needed. This way, the application efficiently manages memory by reusing existing objects for characters that appear multiple times

## When to Use

* The Flyweight pattern is particularly effective in Java applications that use a large number of objects.
* When storage costs are high due to the quantity of objects, Flyweight helps by sharing intrinsic data and managing extrinsic state separately.
* Most of the object state can be made extrinsic.
* Many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects once the extrinsic state is removed.
* The application doesn't depend on object identity. Since flyweight objects may be shared, identity tests will return true for conceptually distinct objects
