# Strategy Pattern in Java: Streamlining Object Behaviors with Interchangeable Algorithms

## Intent of Design Pattern

Define a family of algorithms in Java, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable to enhance software development using the Strategy design pattern. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of the clients that use it

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

A practical real-world example of the Strategy design pattern in Java is evident in car navigation systems, where algorithm flexibility is paramount. Different navigation algorithms (such as shortest route, fastest route, and scenic route) can be used to determine the best path from one location to another. Each algorithm encapsulates a specific strategy for calculating the route. The user (client) can switch between these algorithms based on their preferences without changing the navigation system itself. This allows for flexible and interchangeable navigation strategies within the same system.

## When to Use

* You need to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and want to switch algorithms at runtime.
* There are multiple related classes that differ only in their behavior.
* An algorithm uses data that clients shouldn't know about.
* A class defines many behaviors and these appear as multiple conditional statements in its operations
