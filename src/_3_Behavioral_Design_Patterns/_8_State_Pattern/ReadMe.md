# State Pattern in Java: Enhancing Behavior Dynamics with State Encapsulation

## Intent of Design Pattern

Enable an object to alter its behavior dynamically as its internal state changes, optimizing Java application responsiveness.

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

Imagine a traffic light system at an intersection. The traffic light can be in one of three states: Green, Yellow, or Red. Depending on the current state, the traffic light's behavior changes:

1) Green State: Cars are allowed to pass through the intersection.
2) Yellow State: Cars are warned that the light will soon turn red, so they should prepare to stop.
3) Red State: Cars must stop and wait for the light to turn green.

In this scenario, the traffic light uses the State design pattern. Each state (Green, Yellow, Red) is represented by a different object that defines what happens in that particular state. The traffic light (context) delegates the behavior to the current state object. When the state changes (e.g., from Green to Yellow), the traffic light updates its state object and changes its behavior accordingly

## When to Use

* An object's behavior depends on its state, and it must change its behavior at runtime depending on that state.
* Operations have large, multipart conditional statements that depend on the object's state
