# Interpreter Pattern in Java: Building Custom Parsers for Java Applications

## Intent of Design Pattern

The Interpreter design pattern is used to define a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to handle this grammar. This pattern is useful in scenarios where a specific set of rules or grammar needs to be interpreted and acted upon, such as in arithmetic expressions or scripting languages

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

Consider a calculator application designed to interpret and calculate expressions entered by users. The application uses the Interpreter pattern in Java to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions such as "5 + 3 * 2". Here, the Interpreter translates each part of the expression into objects that represent numbers and operations. These objects follow a defined grammar that allows the application to understand and compute the result correctly based on the rules of arithmetic. Each element of the expression corresponds to a class in the program's structure, simplifying the parsing and evaluation process for any inputted arithmetic formula.

## When to Use

Use the Interpreter design pattern when there is a language to interpret, and you can represent statements in the language as abstract syntax trees. The Interpreter pattern works best when

* The grammar is simple. For complex grammars, the class hierarchy for the grammar becomes large and unmanageable. Tools such as parser generators are a better alternative in such cases. They can interpret expressions without building abstract syntax trees, which can save space and possibly time.
* Efficiency is not a critical concern. The most efficient interpreters are usually not implemented by interpreting parse trees directly but by first translating them into another form. For example, regular expressions are often transformed into state machines. But even then, the translator can be implemented by the Interpreter pattern, so the pattern is still applicable
