# Observer Pattern in Java: Mastering Reactive Interfaces in Java Applications

## Intent of Design Pattern

The Observer pattern in Java defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, ensuring that when one object updates its state, all dependent observers are notified and updated automatically, enhancing system responsiveness and modularity

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

In a real-world example, consider a news agency system where the agency (subject) publishes news articles, and multiple news outlets (observers) subscribe to receive updates. Whenever the news agency publishes a new article, it automatically notifies all the subscribed news outlets. These outlets can then update their platforms (like websites, TV broadcasts, or newspapers) with the latest news. This ensures that all subscribers get the latest information without the news agency needing to know the specifics of each outlet's update process. This decouples the news agency from the subscribers, promoting flexibility and modularity in how updates are handled

## When to Use

* When an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other. Encapsulating these aspects in separate objects lets you vary and reuse them independently.
* When a change to one object requires changing others, and you don't know how many objects need to be changed.
* When an object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are. In other words, you don't want these objects tightly coupled
