# Chain of Responsibility Pattern in Java: Building Robust Request Handling Mechanisms

## Intent of Design Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern in Java is a behavioral design pattern that decouples the sender of a request from its receivers by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. The receiving objects are chained and the request is passed along the chain until an object handles it.

## Detailed Explanation with Real-World Examples

A real-world example of the Chain of Responsibility pattern in Java is a technical support call center. When implementing this Java design pattern, each level of support represents a handler in the chain. When a customer calls in with an issue, the call is first received by a front-line support representative. If the issue is simple, the representative handles it directly. If the issue is more complex, the representative forwards the call to a second-level support technician. This process continues, with the call being escalated through multiple levels of support until it reaches a specialist who can resolve the problem. Each level of support represents a handler in the chain, and the call is passed along the chain until it finds an appropriate handler, thereby decoupling the request from the specific receiver.

## When to Use

* More than one object may handle a request, and the handler isn't known a priori. The handler should be ascertained automatically.
* You want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly.
* The set of objects that can handle a request should be specified dynamically
